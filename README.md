# Evolate: the first ever multistructered dynamic data structure

The idea behind evolate is that data is always changing. When the average person uses a data structure in their program, they usually aren't
considering the implications that structure could have on your CPU, Memory, or Efficiency. Certain features of the data your storing, your use case, and the sort/search algorithms you chose to use may be inefficent. 

Evolate solves the problem using ML. Evolate keeps track of the features of the data you're storing and based on custom trained model, it will automatically switch between different data implementations, search, and sort alorithms to maximize efficiency while minimizing stress on your PC. 

Data Structures Evolate can use:
    -> Singly Linked List
    -> Queue
    -> Sequence
    -> Tree Map : binary search tree implementation
    -> Hash Map
